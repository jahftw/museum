                A garage box in The Hague is where the adventure began in 2008, with two friends Hasan Tasdemir
                and Pascal Rappailles. The garage box soon became too small after which they moved to a shed on an
                industrial area. Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be
                transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture building. When this building also had to be emptied,
                the then collection of 10 arcade video games with some spare parts was stored in an old
                showroom for classic cars. Since there was no space there to refurbish or play the cabinets, it was
                looked for suitable space.

                That was found in 2011 at the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. There Hasan decided to rent the
                and the adventure could grow into its own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.

            <p class="abouttekst">
                In 2016, Hasan came into contact with Jan Kragt, city marketer of the municipality of Zoetermeer, who was deeply
                impressed by the collection, suggested the idea of turning it into a museum and establishing a foundation for that purpose.
                foundation. On the spot, Hasan and Jan came up with the name and the National Videogame Museum was born. Together
                Together with a number of important players from the Dutch gaming community, the National Video Game
                Videogame Museum foundation was then established.
                The city council was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to support the museum financially.
                This made it possible to rent a heated storage facility where the entire collection could be housed and
                partially be displayed.
                In early 2017, in close cooperation with the municipality, a real museum location was found: the former
                V&D building in the city center of Zoetermeer.
