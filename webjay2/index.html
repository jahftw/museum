                        We had family visiting from overseas and decided to visit here with our children and they
                        enjoyed the day very much.
                        I think the parents may have enjoyed it more than the children
                        (if that's possible) as they had lots of old school games from the 1980's.
                        Great!!!

                        I liked games such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Pinball.
                        My sons played on a variety of games and loved the fact that there are no coins required.
                        They could relax and have fun.

                        had such fun in here!
                        They have a lot of old and interesting games and you can soend the whole day in there.
                        Most games can be played with 2 people and some with 4
